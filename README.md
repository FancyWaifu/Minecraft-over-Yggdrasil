# Minecraft-over-Yggdrasil

Idea for this project:
I want to create some software that can be used to managae a minecraft server over the yggdrasil network. Whenever I say manage, more of a python tool that installs everything you need and gets it setup. The Yggdrasil network is awesome and want more people to use it lol
